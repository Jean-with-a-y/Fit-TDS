The file to run is fit_TDSg.py
One can do it with the command prompt:

cd C:\filePath\fit_TDS
python fit_TDSg.py

Initialisation:

The thickness of the artificial sample given the output  file is 5 mm. One can take 1% of uncertainty.
One can use input.txt and output.txt files

Model parameters:
You can take any algorithm, a swarmsize of 1000 and 20 iterations.
One can use the file example_input_parameters.txt:
- Photonic structure is Transmission Fabry-Perot
- Don't fit thickness
- No Drude term to find
- One Lorentz oscillator
- No Debye oscillator
If you don't want to use file, you can take +-50% of uncertainty on the other parameters
it has one Lorentz Oscillators at 500 GHz with a width of 100 GHz. Its oscillators strentgh is 0.001. There is no Drude term to find.

You should find the good result in about 1 minute.
