fit@TDS Installation guide for windows


To use the fit@TDS code on Windows one will need Python version 2.7 or higher with a number of properly installed packages:
NumPy - http://www.numpy.org/
pyOpt - https://github.com/madebr/pyOpt and http://pyopt.org/ (we hope that this website will be available again soon)
pyswarm - https://pythonhosted.org/pyswarm/
We note that the stable work on Python 3 is not guaranteed (though it would be appreciated if one modifies the code for the proper work on Python 3 as well)


For unexperienced Python users (or for the lazy ones) we propose the fallowing procedure to prepare your PC to run the code on it:

1) Check that Python and/or Anaconda are not installed on your PC, otherwise we advise to uninstall the existing version so on not to get any misleading dependencies after the following steps. Reboot the PC.

2) We advise to use Anaconda - a free and open source distribution of the Python programming language, which includes a number of useful programs and allows an easy package management.
Download the Anaconda installer with Python 2.7* version for Windows respecting the bit architecture of your processor: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

3) Run the installer. We advise to do it under administrator rights. We suggest to install anaconda for all users on the PC and to accept the destination folder (normally C:\ProgramData\Anaconda2) proposed by the installer. 
We also suggest not to accept any of the advanced options or add-ons during the installation process. Reboot the PC after the installation is over.

4) Run Anaconda. Open the Environments menu. Check that the NumPy package is already installed.

5) Through the Environments menu find and install the following packages:
* mpi4py (for parallel computing)
* Swig compiler (version 1.3 and higher)
* MinGW compiler (other c/FORTRAN compiler may also be used)
[If this step does not work properly, one can add the package using the anaconda prompt and these command lines :
conda install mpi4py
conda install Swig
conda install MinGW 
If you have problem with installation of mpi4py, fit@tds will work perfectly without, this is just an option, please just commant the line with comment # this can be commented if mpi4py was not installed successfully 
]


6) Anaconda distribution includes the Anaconda Prompt which we suggest to use for the installation of the pyOpt and pyswarm packages:
pyOpt is an object-oriented framework for formulating and solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems. It can be installed by the following command:
conda install -c mutirri pyopt
The pyswarm package is a gradient-free, evolutionary optimization package for python that supports constraints. 
Your Anaconda distribution normally includes the pip package, so install the pyswarm package by the following command:
pip install --upgrade pyswarm

7) Reboot the computer.

8)unzip the fit@tds files (fit@TDS.py, epsillon3.py and finalplot.py)

Congratulations, now you should be able to run the fit@tds code!

To do so one can use the Spyder environment (also included to the Anaconda distribution) or just to run the the fit@TDS.py by the following two commands in the Anaconda Prompt:
Write the path to the folder containing the fit@TDS.py file, for example by
cd C:\Users\Admin\Documents\fit@tds
Run the file:
fit@tds.py
