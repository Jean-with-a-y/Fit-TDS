1. There is a problem with the installation of pyOpt package. 
--> Did you reboot your computer after installing pyOpt?
Did you look in the Anaconda environment if pyOpt was correctly installed?
Otherwise there may be a problem in the installation of MinGW fortran compiler. 
Installation via anaconda prompt does not always work, sometimes you have to download it directly from google to install it.

2. Is there any specific form requirement for the data?
--> The data is in .txt. It just takes two columns of data. Care must be taken that the time window is the same in the case of the reference and the sample.

3. Is it possible to just eliminate the FP effect without using the optimization part? 
--> You can choose to take the FP effect into account or not during your optimizations, but it will not be possible to eliminate it. 
The FP effect is very useful so that the software can find the right parameters when optimizing, it is generally advisable to keep it. 
If you don't want to have the FP, you can cut your time trace and do the fitting without.
